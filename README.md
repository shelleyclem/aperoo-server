# Apéroo: A Node server using PostgreSQL and Sequelize

Apéroo is a happy hour/cocktail logging PERN app, as well as the capstone project for my Red Badge at ElevenFifty Academy. The Apéroo server stores 3 different tables for Users, Drinks and Bar Reviews. I created full CRUD endpoints for two of the three models as well as several extra GET endpoints, which I'll use in the future as I work more on the client. In the middleware, I used json web tokens to validate user sessions and user roles.

### Notes
While I struggled with the client for this project, I wholeheartedly enjoyed working on the server. Testing endoints in Postman before and after deployment was a fun problem-solving exercise, and it was so exciting to see all the endpoints working in the end!
